# What does it do?
Bluebird can install Oculus Quest games, uninstall them, grant mic, read and write permissions for those games, change your name in those games, push maps for Pavlov: Shack and install any APK you choose!

# How do you install it?
Go to the Releases page (https://github.com/TheModernEra/Bluebird-For-Windows/releases/latest) and download the setup file. Run it and follow the prompts to install Bluebird!

# I have an issue!
If you have any issues with this app, feel free to DM me on Discord at **Modern Era#6041** for help.

# Building
If for some reason you want to compile this app on your own, the only extra thing you need is adb.exe, AdbWinApi.dll and AdbWinUsbApi.dll in the exe directory when you test the app, or else the adb functions (so everything) won't work. These are provided in the platform-tools download from Google. Once you gather those files you should be able to just run the solution file and it should compile fine.
