# What does it do?
Bluebird for Windows can install Oculus Quest games, uninstall them, grant mic, read and write permissions for those games, change your name in those games, and push maps for Pavlov: Shack.

# How do you install it?
Go to the Releases page (https://github.com/TheModernEra/Bluebird-For-Windows/releases/latest) and download the zip file for the latest version. Extract that, then run Bluebird-for-Windows.exe.
